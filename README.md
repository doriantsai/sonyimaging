Python code and instructions on using gphoto2 to programmatically control Sony A7R3 camera 

Currently following along this tutorial:

Sony Camera also has to be set:
- `USB Connection` to `PC Remote` in Menu: `Setup4`
- `USB Power Supply` to `On`
- `PC Remote Settings`: `PC+Camera` (I think this simply allows on-camera control during remote session)
